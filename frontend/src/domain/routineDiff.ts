/**
 * Diffs a finished workout against the routine it started from, so the summary
 * can offer "update the routine to match what you just did".
 *
 * STRUCTURE ONLY: exercises added / removed / reordered, set counts, set types,
 * and rest timers. Never logged actuals (weights, reps) — those differ from
 * targets almost every session, so prompting on them would fire every workout
 * and get dismissed reflexively.
 *
 * Why targets are absent rather than merely excluded: a workout set has a single
 * `weight`/`reps` pair, so an edited *target* is indistinguishable from a logged
 * *actual*. Telling them apart needs a schema change. Set *type* has no such
 * problem — `routine_sets.type` already exists — which is why it is compared.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in the summary screen so it can be tested directly;
 * `node --test` only sees `src/`.
