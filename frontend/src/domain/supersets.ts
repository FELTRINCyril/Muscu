 * Supersets: a group of exercises trained in rounds (#53, board 11a).

 * has existed all along and import/export have been carrying it — nothing has
 * ever read it, so workouts imported with supersets have been quietly losing
 * their structure on screen.
 *
 * The rule that makes a superset a superset is the rest: you alternate through
 * the partners and rest once at the end of the round, not after each exercise.
 * Everything here exists to work out when that moment is.
 *
 * Pure, so `node --test` covers it.
