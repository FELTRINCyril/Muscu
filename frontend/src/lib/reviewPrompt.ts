/**
 * App Store review nudge.
 *
 * After a user has *genuinely finished* a handful of workouts we ask iOS to show
 * its native review prompt (StoreKit's `SKStoreReviewController`, surfaced by
 * expo-store-review). We never draw our own rating UI around it — Apple forbids
 * gating a review behind a custom dialog, and iOS already throttles the real
 * prompt to ~3×/year, so this call is a soft nudge that may show nothing.
 *
 * All state lives in SecureStore so it survives reinstalls-with-restore the same
 * way the rest of the app's small persisted flags do. Everything here is
 * best-effort: a single try/catch swallows any failure so a review nudge can
 * never break the Summary screen it's fired from.
