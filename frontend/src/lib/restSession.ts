/**
 * Persistence for the running rest ("break") countdown of the active workout,
 * so it survives the workout screen unmounting — leaving the screen (minimise /
 * navigate away) tears down component state, which used to reset a running rest
 * to zero on return (#43).
 *
 * What is stored is the *absolute* end timestamp (epoch ms), never a remaining
 * count: on remount `remaining = max(0, endsAt - now)` is recomputed, so the
 * countdown is correct immediately however long the screen was gone.
 *
 * Two layers, keyed by workout id:
 *  - a module-level Map that outlives any screen mount, which covers the
 *    reported case (navigating within the app), and
 *  - expo-secure-store (already a dependency), so a rest also survives a full
 *    app kill / cold start.
 *
 * The store is never cleared on mount — only when the rest is skipped, ends, or
 * the workout is finished / discarded (see clearRest) — so restoring on remount
 * cannot race a clear.
