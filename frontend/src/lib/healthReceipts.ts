/**
 * Health read "receipts" — the honest signal behind the Apple Health screen.
 *
 * HealthKit deliberately hides *read* authorisation, so a read switch in the ON
 * position can never mean "granted". The one thing we always know honestly is
 * whether data actually ARRIVED. Each read pref therefore carries a companion
 * "last received" record (timestamp + a display value) stored beside the prefs
 * in SecureStore (`ischys.healthPref.*` → `ischys.healthRecv.*`).
 *
 * The screen reads these to render a receipt:
 *   - data within 30 days      → `Receiving · <value>`   (success)
 *   - switch on, nothing ever  → `Nothing received yet`   (warning) + explainer
 *   - switch off               → plain description         (no status colour)
 *
 * `recordReadReceipt` is the write side. It belongs to the sync layer, wherever
 * a metric is actually read from HealthKit (heart rate / active energy off an
 * Apple Watch). It lives here so the screen and the sync layer share one shape
 * and one set of keys rather than drifting apart.
