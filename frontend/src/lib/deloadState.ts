/**
 * What the deload advisory remembers between sessions (#70).
 *
 * The advisory's whole design is restraint — one card per fortnight, six weeks
 * of silence after a dismissal — and none of that works without memory of what
 * was already shown. Kept in SecureStore beside the other device-local
 * preferences: it describes this person's relationship with the prompt, not
 * their training, so it never syncs and belongs in no table.
 *
 * Accepting a deload stores a window, not weights. Nothing is ever written to a
 * set: `domain/progression` reads the window and suggests lighter numbers while
 * it is open, and the user remains free to ignore every one of them.
